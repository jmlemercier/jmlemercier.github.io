I"<p>Voxline Audio is a company of 4, awarded Prix Bettencourt in 2018 for its designing and handcrafting of loudspeakers equipped with linear motors, bending waves panels and natural materials (asiatic papers, wood, vinyl glues, blends of varnish). In collaboration with Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique Musique (IRCAM, Paris), I lead a study of the electroacoustic properties of the loudspeakers in terms of directivity, power and most importantly nonlinear behaviour and harmonic distortion. For these latter topics, I lead research work in signal processing and made use of innovative methods of nonlinear parameters identification designed by D. Bouvier (IRCAM) using homophase and homogenous signals separation and Volterra series decomposition.</p>
