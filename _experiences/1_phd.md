I am currently working as a PhD student in the Signal Processing lab of Universität Hamburg under the supervision of Prof. Dr-Ing. Timo Gerkmann, in collaboration with Advanced Bionics, one of the major companies for cochlear implants in Europe. 

My focus is on neural network-based speech processing for dereverberation in hearing devices. Our aim is to develop new, real-time capable algorithms capable of dereveberating and denoising the mixture speech received at the hearing device microphone array. The techniques used range from DNN-assisted real-time Kalman filtering to purely DNN-based multi-frame single-channel dereverberation and score-based generative modelling
