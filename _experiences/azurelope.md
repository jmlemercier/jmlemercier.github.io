Azurelope Ltd designs digital solutions such as REBIM™, a Web Application offering multiple project-management tools, building-data visualization and livefeed-data monitoring. For the benefit of Assystem Technologies UK, I helped contribute to REBIM™ by developing web-based data visualization tools and integrate those into interactive dashboards with special care about UI/UX. These dashboards are used as user-friendly tools meant for whole engineering teams to have better and simpler insights over the project timeline, their objectives and the building facility live data.
