<p>
We present in this paper an informed single-channel dereverberation method based on conditional generation with diffusion models. With knowledge of the room impulse response, the anechoic utterance is generated via reverse diffusion using a measurement consistency criterion coupled with a neural network that represents the clean speech prior. The proposed approach is largely more robust to measurement noise compared to a state-of-the-art informed single-channel dereverberation method, especially for non-stationary noise. Furthermore, we compare to other blind dereverberation methods using diffusion models and show superiority of the proposed approach for large reverberation times.
</p>
<p>
We motivate the presented algorithm by introducing an extension for blind dereverberation allowing joint estimation of the room impulse response and anechoic speech. Audio samples and code can be found online.
