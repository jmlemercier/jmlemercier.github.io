In addition to all the classical Fourier spectrum estimation tools, we develop here a method for analyzing the harmonic content in an adapted fashion for nonlinear systems, more precisely for dynamic systems that can be described with a  <b>Volterra series</b> formalism. The methods presented here were issued in the context of the <a href="http://www.voxlineaudio.com" class="inner-link">Voxline Audio</a> - <a href="http://www.ircam.fr" class="inner-link">IRCAM</a> collaboration centered on <a class="inner-link" href="{% post_url 2020-01-13-voxline %}">nonlinear characterization of loudspeaker prototypes</a>.
