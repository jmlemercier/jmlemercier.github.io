title: Bio-inspired Neural Networks nonlinear filters for noise reduction
excerpt: Imperial College London MSc Thesis supervised by Dr Dan F. M. Goodman on noise-reducting nonlinear filters. The structure of the filters is provided by a trainable neural network inspired by the auditory periphery system.

The human ability to reduce noise from different sources and types (babbling noise, white noise, musical noise, non-stationary noise...) is yet unrivalled and, if many signal processing algorithms demonstrate increasing performances, the gap between the available technologies and the treatment needed for hearing aids for example is still wide. In this study, we dive into Neural Networks with a strong inspiration from the structure of the human auditory periphery system to try and design nonlinear filters for adaptive and intelligent nosie reduction.
